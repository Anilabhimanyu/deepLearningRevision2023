# deepLearningRevision2O23

Only practice keeps our basics & fundamentals strong, which are foundation for any great project developer,
Since a year, I explored a lot more concepts in deep learning, but again i'm practicing the overall as a quick revision,
Hope this is making keeping in mind of beginers, you can use this repo for your learning of DL


weights are for inputs
bias for neuron
i.e, output2=inputs[0]*weights[0]+inputs[1]*weights[1]+inputs[2]*weights[2]+bias
i.e, len of inputs and weights are equal while alway bias will be single value only




Questions or doubts will common for every beginer
1. what is neuron, how it is diff from perceptron?
2. what is input layer?
3. what is output layer?
4. what is hiddern layer?


Note:
1. Inputs will be either data from sensors or from other source or output of previos layers
2.
